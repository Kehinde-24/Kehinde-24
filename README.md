###  Process Reflection

I created this CV to reflect my career shift into Data Analytics. During the process, I researched top resume practices for tech roles, reviewed samples from experienced analysts, and gathered feedback from mentors. One challenge was narrowing down relevant experience without having full-time job history in the field, so I emphasized project work, training, and campaign contributions. The process helped me clarify my value as a learner and emerging analyst, and reinforced the importance of clear communication in both design and content.
